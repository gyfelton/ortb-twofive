openrtb data structures

This is a slightly modified version of the ORTB 2.5 spec. There may be some fields/objects missing as the focus was on mobile apps. The objects also have validitor struct tags, please look at the test files if you wish to know how to run the validator. Likewise please feel free to fork and modify.
